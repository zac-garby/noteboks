# Noteboks

A note/organisation vault, similar to Logseq, implemented as an LSP and a Zed
editor extension.

The name, noteboks, is probably temporary, but I needed a name to fork the
[zed-org](https://github.com/hron/zed-org) Zed extension.

The base file type is org files, i.e. Emacs' `org-mode`.
